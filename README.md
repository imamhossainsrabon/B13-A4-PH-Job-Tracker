1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

By getElementById, we can select only one specific element and it return only one element.

By getElementsByClassName, we can select multiple element with class and it return HTMLCollection

By querySelector, we can select any element of the document, if we would like to call an element with id - we must use '#' with the id in the quotation. And it select only one and the first element.

By querySelectorAll, we can select a lot of elements at once and it returns an array like object which is colde nodeList.
